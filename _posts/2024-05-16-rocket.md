# <span style="color:#fff;">Goals</span>

- Break the sound barrier
- Reach an altitude of 2000m
- Successful tracking and recovery
- Learn how to build subminimum rockets

<br><br>

# <span style="color:#fff;">Fall 2024</span>
Around that time, couple months after my successful minimum diameter launch I've came up with an idea of building subminimum rocket - where 
motor casing acts as a rocket airframe. Originally I was planning to use 40mm aluminium tube, but I settled on 45mm instead due to lack of 
space to contain all of the necessary electronics. Nozzle was made from steel and endcap was made from aluminium. Preliminary simulations said that
rocket will go 2100m into the air with maximum speed of Mach 1.26 or around 432m/s with acceleration around 38G / 380m/s^2.

In December, the nosecone tip and fins were made. The tip was machined from aluminium, and the fins were cut from 1 millimeter thick carbon fiber sheet.

In January I laminated fiberglass tubes for the fincan and avionics bay. They were made from 2 fiberglass sleeves and epoxy resin.

  Then I went on to making the rest of fincan. I glued 4 fins using 5-minute epoxy and made fillets from laminating epoxy resin with microballoons.

  Recovery
</p>

<p>
  For recovery I used 30cm nylon parachute and about 2.5 meters of kevlar cord. Due to launch site limitations, descent rate was about 11m/s. Flight computer responsible for recovery was Arecorder, well-known in Polish Rocketry Association, with a lot of flight heritage. I used two ejection charges, one for main separation and one as a backup. I also made sure that recovery system works.

# <span style="color:#fff;">September 6</span>
<p>
  On the first weekend of September an event called "Festiwal Meteora" took place on Błędowska Desert in Poland. On Saturday, 6th, I made last finishing touches to the rocket, for example little correction of motor endcap. Rest of that day I spent on documenting whole event. When I got back to hotel room the problems started. Firstly, the flight computer did not recognize memory card, which is a must in order to arm the computer. Additionally, while assembling the motor, the nozzle got stuck. I wasted 1 hour on trying to fix these things, which didn't bring any success. 
</p>

# <span style="color:#fff;">September 7 - Launch Day</span>
<p>
  When I woke up at 7 a.m I quickly tried for the last time to unstuck the nozzle - this time successfully. The memory card problem was solved with my friend bringing a spare one to the launch site. At roughly 9 a.m I arrived at the desert and started preparing rocket for launch and made ejection charges. - it took quite long, so slowly I was getting a rush fever. Then set up launch tower and prepared ignition system. I quickly packed the chute and it was ready for launch.

  Around 1:30 p.m I attempted to launch, but igniter failed to ignite the motor. After getting a bit annoyed, I've convinced myself that I'll try again. Ten minutes later, countdown began. This time, igniter worked and the rocket went like a laser beam, not even a tiny wiggle. Before motor burnout, it vanished in the clouds. Video below:

<p>
  I was shocked how straight and fast it went. I quickly grabbed antenna with ground receiver, and waited, waited a bit more, and after roughly 40 seconds I heard along with my friends a muffled sound similar to gun shot. I suspected that rocket came ballistic, and I was sure it did after the ground receiver showed last data frame from an altitude of 750 meters with negative speed. I copied coordinates of the last packet sent by tracker and we went on a little walk to see what was left of the rocket. This is the screen of last position sent.

Ten minutes later we arrived. We then saw bright orange fins sticking out of the ground. The kevlar cord was ripped apart. I also found two fractured parts of the nosecone, without chute and aluminium tip.

The stainless steel rod was bent, the whole avionics section got so compressed that only dust and small elements were left of the 
electronics sled. Antenna of the tracker fell off, the batteries were also destroyed. When I got back from event, I disassembled the rest of the rocket.
Flight computer was cracked in half. Suprisingly the memory card was untouched, but only from outside. My PC didn't recognize it and It got hot rapidly, probably something happend inside of it on the logical level. So I don't have working flight computer nor data from that flight.

I found the rocket with ripped kevlar cord, without nosecone. What was strange to me was that the two nosecone fragments were laying approximetly 20-30 meters of the impact location. 
Larger fragment with sharp edges sticking out looked like it was "cut" through by something.

 It seemed that kevlar cord "cut" the nosecone and sharp edges from fractured plastic then damaged the kevlar cord. It didn't make sense why would that happen, tests done before flight had shown that it couldn't happen. For me, only logical reasoning is that both ejection charges fired simultaneously. When the main, apogee charge fired, poorly made insulation of backup charge did not block pressure and heat generated, causing the second charge to ignite as well. I don't have an idea what pressure it could have generated, but I think that combined force gave the nosecone such extreme momentum that kevlar cord could cut through easily.
