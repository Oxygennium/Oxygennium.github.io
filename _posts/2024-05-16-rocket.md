Around that time, couple months after my successful minimum diameter launch I've came up with an idea of building subminimum rocket - where 
motor casing acts as a rocket airframe. Originally I was planning to use 40mm aluminium tube, but I settled on 45mm instead due to lack of 
space to contain all of the necessary electronics.

      This is the 45mm solid rocket motor used in <em>Fire 2 Power</em>.
